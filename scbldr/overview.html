		<h3>NJIT Course Schedule Builder For Students
		<br/>Who Can't Read Good
		and Want To Learn To Do Other Stuff Good Too</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="bdy">
First, a couple of points:
<ol>
<li>This site is not officially endorsed or supported by NJIT, or anybody for that matter, including myself.</li>
<li>This site has been tested against FF3+, Chrome 525+, Opera 10+, IE8*, and IE9*</li>
<li>Schedule persists until the session times out or you close the browser.</li>
</ol>
<sup><em>* IE8 and IE9 have been minimally tested. Just enough to know most things work.</em></sup>
<br/>
<sup><em>** UI inconsistencies in IE7 (missing borders, stuck loading icon, etc...).</em></sup>

<strong>How do I use this?</strong>
<p>Basic overview on how to use this tool:</p>
<p>
To the right is an input box. Enter courses there (e.g., CS341). There is no
course list or anything remotely similar. If you don't know what classes you want to take,
look at the catalog. If you can't remember the numbers, look at the catalog.
</p>
<p>
You can also search by starting the term with @ (e.g., '@FOUND OF COMPUTER').
</p>
<p>
After a course has been selected, it gets added into the panel below the search box. A table
of all available sections is shown for each course (the only information shown is the section number,
instructor, and a comment icon, if there are any).
Selecting a particular section will add that section to the time grid.
</p>
<strong>HELP... printing doesn't show all the days.</strong>
<p>
The resolution on your monitor is likely too high. Decrease the width of the window then go to <em>Print Preview</em>.
</p>
<p>
<em>Update:</em> printing should work across all browsers. Click on the print icon above the grid.
</p>
<strong>HELP... I can't find any schedules.</strong>
<p>
Either there are no possible schedules (unresolvable conflicts) or there are no
possible schedules (you have a schedule picked).
<br/>
The schedule finder only searches courses that have <em>NO</em> selected section.<br/>
To remove a section, remove the entire course or remove it from the grid (hover over the event and an <span class='ui-button ui-icon ui-icon-close'></span> will magicaly appear).
</p>
<p>
Sections can also be removed by clicking on the <span class="ui-button ui-widget ui-icon ui-icon-trash"></span> button above the grid,
which will clear <em>all</em> sections.
</p>
<strong>HELP... I can't remove a constraint.</strong>
<p>
Hover over the constraint on the left-side. An X will pop-up along the top-right corner. Click it.
