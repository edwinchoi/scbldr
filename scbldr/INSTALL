Required software:
==================
	1. PHP 5.2+
	2. An HTTP server (Apache, IIS, Lighttpd)
	3. MySQL 5.0+

Install steps
=============
	1.	From the command-line prompt, navigate to the directory containing this file.

	2.	Open up the MySQL command-line client
		a.	Type the following:
			CREATE DATABASE scbldr;
			
			USE scbldr;
			
			SOURCE '/path/to/install-directory/tables.sql';
			
			INSERT INTO TERMINFO(semester, disp_name, active) VALUES("2011F", "Fall 2011", TRUE);
			UPDATE TERMINFO SET active = TRUE WHERE semester = '2011F';
			UPDATE TERMINFO SET active = FALSE WHERE semester <> '2011F';
			
			quit

	3.	Next, we need to setup the DB connection script.
		From the command-line prompt, type in the following:
		a.	For windows:
			ECHO ^<?php $conn = new mysqli("localhost", "$username", "$password", "$dbname"); ?^> > dbconnect.php
		
		b.	For Bash:
			echo '<?php $conn = new mysqli("localhost", "$username", "$password", "$dbname"); ?>' > dbconnect.php

	4.	Run the data collector.
		From the command-line prompt, type in:
			php _collect.php
		
		This will take between 10 seconds to a little over a minute to complete, depending on the machine and network.
		If for any reason the script fails before completing, you may get an error that an update is in progress.
		In this case, you'll need to reset the updating flag by doing the following:
		
		From MySQL client:
			UPDATE TERMINFO SET updating = FALSE WHERE active = TRUE;
	
	5.	Map the directory to the HTTP server.
		
		For Apache HTTP Server, open httpd.conf and add the following:
			
			<Directory "/path/to/www/scbldr/">
			    AllowOverride All
			    Options Indexes FollowSymlinks
			    Order allow,deny
			    Allow from all
			</Directory>
			Alias /scbldr "/path/to/www/scbldr/"
